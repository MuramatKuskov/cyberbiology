# EVOLUTION SIMULATION
The project represents a field populated by bots. Bots can interact with environment, such as food, poisons, other bots and remains.
Each bot has its own genetic, which determines bot's behavior and possibilities.
During their lifetime, bots are reproducing and mutate which accounts for biodiversity.
